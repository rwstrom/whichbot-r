/// CombatStrategy is a strategy that attracts the bot to the nearest waypoint to its combat target, if set.
/// The idea is to be able to harness the WaypointNavMethod to move walking lifeforms up ramps, round corners,
/// etc as appropriate to get to the target.  Skulks will typically just be able to run in a straight line towards
/// the target, but that doesn't work out well for Onos, for example.
